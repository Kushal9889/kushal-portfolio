 * Funnel events.

 * Five events, no cookies, no third-party script, no identifiers. Enough to
 * answer whether the page converts and nothing more: without it there is no way
 * to tell a site that impresses people from one that impresses people who then
 * close the tab.
 *
 * Uses sendBeacon so a contact click still reports after the page starts
 * unloading, which is exactly the event most likely to be lost otherwise.
