 * Compiled without a checkpointer. LangGraph persists state after every node by
 * default, which is the right default for long-running stateful agents and the
 * wrong one here: a Postgres saver costs 20-50ms per write, and this graph runs
 * three nodes to answer a question in a conversation that lives in the browser
 * tab. Conversation history is passed in per request instead.
 *
 * That last sentence was false for as long as it was written here. Nothing
 * accepted history, so the trade being described -- durability given up for
 * latency, with the conversation carried by the client -- was only half
 * implemented: the durability was gone and the conversation was too. The
 * streaming path in stream.ts now takes the history the browser holds, which is
 * what makes the decision above an actual decision rather than an omission with
 * a paragraph attached.
 *
 * This graph stays single-turn on purpose. It backs the eval suite and the
 * hero's measured trace, where a settled answer to one stated question is
 * exactly what should be asserted against.
