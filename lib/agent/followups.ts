 * What the reader can do next, computed rather than generated.

 * suggest questions the corpus cannot answer, which is worse than suggesting
 * nothing: the reader clicks, gets "that is outside what I cover", and stops
 * trusting the box. So none of this comes from a model.
 *
 * Two sources, both already in the corpus and both already checked by a build
 * gate. `artifacts` are openable proof -- a merged pull request, a DOI, a
 * repository -- and every URL in that list is resolved by `npm run verify:links`
 * on each build, so an offer can never point at a dead page. `asks` are
 * questions written by hand beside the section that answers them, so accepting
 * one is guaranteed to land somewhere the retriever can reach.
 *
 * The cost of this is that the offers are only as good as the corpus. That is
 * the correct cost: it makes them true.
