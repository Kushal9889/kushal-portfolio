/**
 * Typo tolerance, against the vocabulary the corpus actually contains.
 *
 * BM25 matches strings exactly, so a single wrong character removes a term from
 * the query entirely. Measured across five realistic typos, three broke
 * retrieval outright:
 *
 *   Growza          -> Growaza                  survived, dense covered it
 *   LangChian       -> LangChain deepagents     survived
 *   IMG Sytems      -> Questrom                 failed
 *   certifcations   -> What he is good at       failed
 *   Pytorc          -> IMG Systems              failed
 *
 * `IMG Sytems` failed worst, and not in the way it looks. The typo also defeats
 * the section-name check in query.ts, so the question was reclassified from
 * `specific` to `shipped`, and the ranking weights then actively promoted his
 * current role over the employer he had been asked about. A typo did not
 * degrade the answer; it changed the question.
 *
 * The corpus already ships its own dictionary: `df` in index.json is every term
 * the retriever knows, about thirteen hundred of them. An unknown token is
 * mapped to its nearest neighbour in that list before scoring, which is what a
 * search engine does and costs nothing at this size.
