 * paragraph silently downgraded the entire site to keyword-only retrieval and
 * took the projection figure with it. The only signal was one warning line in a
 * build log nobody reads. This is exactly the class of failure the page is about,
 * and it shipped here.
 *
 * The fix is not to cut prose to fit an API limit. Long passages are split into
 * windows on paragraph boundaries, each window is embedded, and the results are
 * mean-pooled into one vector for the chunk. That is the standard treatment for
 * a passage longer than a model's context, it keeps one vector per chunk so
 * retrieval and the projection are unchanged, and the corpus stays whatever
 * length it needs to be.
 *
 * 1400 characters is deliberately conservative against the 512-token limit:
 * this corpus measures about 1.4 tokens per word, and a hard failure here costs
 * the whole index.
