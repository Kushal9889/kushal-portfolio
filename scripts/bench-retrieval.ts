/**
 * What retrieval actually costs and what it actually buys.
 *
 * Retrieval and generation fail for different reasons, so they are measured
 * apart. This measures retrieval alone: no model call, no answer, nothing that
 * depends on a provider being awake. It answers three questions the page makes
 * claims about, and it answers them with numbers rather than with a paragraph.
 *
 *   1. Which distance metric ranks best on this corpus?
 *   2. Does a cross-encoder reranker earn the latency it costs?
 *   3. How long does each configuration take?
 *
 * Written to content/retrieval-bench.json so the page renders what this run
 * produced rather than a figure typed in by hand.

 * When does a linear scan stop being free?

 * The page claims a vector database would add latency and operational surface

 *
 * Brute force is exact by definition: it compares the query against every
 * vector, so its recall is 1.00 and only its cost is in question. An
 * approximate index trades a little of that recall for sublinear search, and it
 * is worth doing at the point where the scan costs more than the error does.
 * Measured here against synthetic vectors of the same shape as the real ones,
 * because the cost depends on count and dimension, not on meaning.
