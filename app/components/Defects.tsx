 * one of them failed silently rather than throwing, which is the same class of
 * bug the published research is about. Read from the corpus, so the agent can
 * answer questions about them and the page cannot claim a guard that no longer
 * exists.

 * without someone editing the line; a guard that is a gate fails the build.
 * They are different promises and the list read as one flat kind, so a reader
 * could not tell "there is a test for this" from "we were careful".
 *
 * Derived from the guard sentence rather than stored twice, for the same reason
 * every other number on this page is derived.
