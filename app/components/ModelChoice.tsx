/**
 * Which model answers, and why that was not a guess.
 *
 * A hundred-odd models are reachable on one key. Picking one because it felt
 * fast is the decision this page exists to argue against, so five were measured
 * on the real pipeline -- same retrieval, same prompt, same cleaning -- and the
 * result is rendered from what `npm run bench:models` wrote rather than typed
 * in by hand.
 *
 * Rendered on paper rather than the console surface, for the same reason the
 * eval matrix is: this is a published result from a build-time run, not
 * something happening while a reader looks at it. The ground has to keep
 * meaning exactly one thing.
 *
 * The headline is the finding rather than the winner. Four of the five could
 * not be told apart, and a table that ranked them anyway would be presenting
 * noise as a result.

        The bar is the slow case, not the average: one request in twenty takes at least that

        is what happens when a model is quick because it says less.
