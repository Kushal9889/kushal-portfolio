 * behaviour for a meaningful share of visitors: everything is simply visible,

   *
   * Under 62rem this never arms. Pinning small-viewport content is flagged for
   * a reason: on a phone the pinned section is close to the whole screen, so a
   * hold that reads as a pause on a desktop reads as the page refusing to move.
   * The tap sequence below is the same four states for that width instead.
   *
   * Above the threshold, the reader drives the sequence with the scrollbar: the
   * swallowed error is struck out, the consequence lands, the guard writes
   * itself in line by line, and the merge credit resolves last. Scrubbed rather
   * than played, so it moves at whatever speed the reader moves and can run
   * backwards, which is the difference between watching something and
   * examining it.
   *
   * Everything is readable before this runs and stays readable if it never
   * does. The stylesheet already resolves the whole diff for Safari and for
   * scripting off; this only takes the same elements and ties their progress to
   * scroll position.
