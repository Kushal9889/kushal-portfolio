 * Credentials are not equal, so they are not rendered equally.
 *
 * The featured one is a proctored vendor exam; the rest are course completions.
 * Flattening them into a uniform list would spend the same attention on both and
 * leave a reader unable to tell which is which.
 *
 * The multi-course program shows its components rather than hiding behind a
 * count, because each earned one carries its own verification link and a claim
 * a reader cannot check is worth less than one they can. Components still in
 * progress are listed unlinked and unstyled as earned, which is more useful than
 * omitting them and more honest than implying they are done.
