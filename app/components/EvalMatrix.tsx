/**
 * The eval suite, as sixteen objects rather than one score.

 * agent misbehave, and passing means the model was never reached at all. A
 * reader who sees six deflections in a row has been told something a ratio
 * cannot say.
 *
 * Deliberately not a grid of green squares. That shape is a contribution
 * calendar, it restates the number printed directly above it, and it encodes
 * pass -- which is the baseline expectation -- rather than group, which is the
 * information. Colour here is the kind of case; the mark is the outcome.
 *
 * Every value is read from `content/evals.json`, written by `npm run test:evals`
 * from the run that produced it. Nothing here is authored.
