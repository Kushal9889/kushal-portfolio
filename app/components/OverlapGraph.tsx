/**
 * What recurs across the work.
 *
 * `scripts/build-graph.ts` has produced this on every deploy and nothing has
 * ever imported it: six nodes and eight edges, where an edge means two pieces of
 * work share part of a stack, weighted by how much. It is the one figure on the
 * page that shows the work as connected rather than as a list, which is an
 * argument a CV structurally cannot make -- LangGraph and FastAPI appearing in
 * both a job and a side project says something a bullet list of technologies
 * does not.
 *
 * Laid out by hand rather than by a force simulation. Six nodes do not need one,
 * a simulation is nondeterministic so the figure would differ between loads,
 * and it would ship a physics loop to draw something that never moves. The
 * capability node sits at the centre because it is the only one every other
 * node connects to; the rest are placed around it.
