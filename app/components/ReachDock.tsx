/**
 * Reaching him from wherever the reader happens to be.
 *
 * The contact block sits at section seven. A reader persuaded by the LangChain
 * fix in section one had to scroll past everything else to act on it, and
 * arrived at the least specific of the seven drafts, because `Reach` is called
 * once with no `context` and the other six openers have never been reachable.
 *
 * This is deliberately not a floating chat bubble. That shape is the most
 * generic object on the web and gets filtered as chrome before it is read. What
 * makes this worth putting on screen is that it knows which section is in view
 * and offers the draft written for that section: "the deepagents bug you
 * reported" while the bug is on screen, "your eval suite" while the suite is.
 * Same machinery the corpus already carries, finally connected to something.
 *
 * It hides itself inside the contact section, because a reader who has arrived
 * at the real thing does not need a shortcut to it.
