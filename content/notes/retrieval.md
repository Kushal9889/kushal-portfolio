## How retrieval on this page works

**The agent answering questions here runs hybrid retrieval: BM25 over the corpus
and dense cosine over precomputed embeddings, fused with reciprocal rank fusion
at k=60.** Both retrievers rank every chunk, and a chunk's final score is the
sum of `1 / (60 + rank)` from each. RRF is used rather than a weighted score
blend because the two retrievers produce numbers on incomparable scales: BM25 is
unbounded and corpus-dependent, cosine similarity is bounded to a narrow band
near the top, and any fixed weighting between them is a constant that has to be
retuned every time the corpus changes. Ranks are comparable by construction.

**The embedding call is skipped when the keyword hit is decisive.** If the top
BM25 score is more than 2.2 times the runner-up, the dense half never runs. A
query like "Growaza" or "NCP-AAI" lands one chunk far clear of everything else,
and no embedding is going to reorder that. The embedding call is one network
round trip and the single largest cost in retrieval, so this is the difference
between an answer that starts immediately and one that waits on an API. The
threshold was tuned by hand against the eval set, not chosen for looking round.

**Reciprocal rank fusion produces exact ties, and the tiebreak matters.** RRF is
symmetric: a chunk ranked first by keyword and second by embedding scores
exactly what a chunk ranked second and first scores. Left to a stable sort, the
tie broke on corpus order, which meant whichever section sat higher in the file
won. That is file layout masquerading as relevance. Ties now break on the better
single rank, because being one retriever's first choice beats being two
retrievers' second, and then on keyword score.

**A retrieved chunk has to earn its place in the context window.** The top-k is
a ceiling rather than a quota: a chunk scoring far under the leader is filler,
and filler is how a grounded answer drifts off the question that was asked. The
first result always survives, because a weak best match is still the best match
and answering from it beats answering from nothing.

**Select-to-ask retrieves on the phrase, not on the sentence wrapped around it.**
Highlighting text on the page sends `What does this mean: "..."`, and every word
of that wrapper is a BM25 term. Those words are common across the whole corpus,
so they dilute the phrase that carries the meaning: a question about the dense
retriever came back grounded in the achievements section. When a question wraps
a quoted span of real length, the span is the query and the wrapper is grammar.

The projection drawn beside this is classical multidimensional scaling on the
full cosine distance matrix, not UMAP or t-SNE. At eighteen chunks every pairwise
distance is already known exactly, so there is nothing to estimate, and both
neighbour-embedding methods are documented to render clusters that do not exist
at that size. Whatever the projection cannot preserve is published as a Kruskal
stress figure beside it rather than hidden.
